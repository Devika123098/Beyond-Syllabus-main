## Overview

Distributed Systems explores the design and implementation of systems that run across multiple connected computers. This advanced Computer Science track course covers consistency, fault tolerance, scalability, and the fundamental challenges in building reliable distributed applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Master distributed system design principles and trade-offs
- Understand consistency models and consensus algorithms
- Learn fault tolerance and replication strategies
- Develop skills in distributed system implementation
- Apply distributed computing concepts to real-world systems
